/**
 * @title Input Settler Purchase
 * @notice Extends InputSettlerBase with order purchasing functionality that allows third parties to buy orders from
 * solvers.
 * @dev This contract implements order purchasing functionality that enables order ownership transfer from solver to
 * purchaser upon successful purchase. It includes a discount-based pricing mechanism where purchasers pay a reduced
 * amount, EIP712 signature verification for purchase authorization, reentry protection and purchase state tracking, and
 * integration with IInputCallback for post-purchase execution.
 *
 * **IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE - FIRST SOLVER ORDER OWNERSHIP:**
 * By default, the owner (address able to claim funds after and order is settled) is the solver of the first output, in
 * case of an order with multiple outputs.
 * This leads to some security considerations:
 * For Users:
 * 1. Denial of Service Risk: The solver of the first output may refuse to fill the other outputs, delaying the order
 * execution until expiry (when user can be refunded).
 *    - Mitigation: Users should ensure that the first output is the most important/valuable, making this attack more
 * costly.
 * 2. Exploitation of different order types: When opening orders, users are able to set different rules for filling
 * them, i.e., output amounts could be determined by a dutch auction. If the order has multiple outputs, the solver of
 * the first output (the owner) can delay the filling of other outputs, which could lead to worse prices for users.
 *    - Mitigation: Users should be cautious when opening orders whose outputs have variable output amounts. In general,
 * users SHOULD NOT open orders where any output other than the first has an order type whose output amount is
 * determined by, for example, a time based mechanism.
 *
 * Users should also consider opening orders with exclusivity for trusted solvers, especially when the order has
 * multiple outputs.
 *
 * For Solvers:
 * 1. Multiple outputs risk: When filling an order, the solver MUST be aware that they will only be able to finalise the
 * order (i.e., claim funds) after filling all of the outputs (potentially in multiple chains).
 * If the solver is unable to do so, the user will be refunded and the order will be considered as not filled.
 *    - Mitigation: Solvers should be aware of all of the risks and variables, such as:
 *      - all outputs must be filled before `fillDeadline` and the proof of the filling transaction must be handled by
 * each oracle before `expiry` time.
 *      - Solvers should be aware that some outputs have callbacks, which is an arbitrary code that is executed during
 * the filling of the output. They should refuse orders with callbacks outside of the primary batch (that containing the
 * first output) unless it's known that it can't possibly revert (considering that a successful off-chain simulation is
 * not a guarantee of on-chain success)
 *        They should understand the risks of each callback and the potential for them to revert the filling of the
 * output, which could lead to the solver not being able to finalise the order.
